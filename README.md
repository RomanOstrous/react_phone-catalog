## Technologies
The following technologies were used to build this project:

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, mixins, and nesting to CSS.
* **BEM**: A naming convention for CSS classes that makes code more modular and easier to read.
* **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations.
* **JavaScript**: The programming language used to build the frontend logic.
